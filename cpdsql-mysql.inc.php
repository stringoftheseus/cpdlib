 * MySQL driver for the CPDSQL function library. All of the functions in this file call into the PHP
 * mysql_* functions to directly communicate with the MySQL server. All of the main functions in the
 * CPDSQL library eventually call one of these to do the final actual work of running the SQL query,
 * parsing the result object, and (when required) converting the data to the requested format.
 * 
 * To add a new SQL database engine to CPDSQL, just copy this file (changing the filename from mysql
 * to whatever new engine is being supported) and reimplement each of these functions using PHP APIs
 * for that particular engine. In most cases the task should be as simple as changing a few function
 * names here any there, though thorough testing is encouraged. Contact the author of the module for
 * more information.

/** Returns data from the given MySQL result object as an array of associative arrays
 *
 * This isn't something you actually want to do on a regular basis, because pulling all the rows and
 * storing them all in memory like this is a very inefficient way of doing things. In fact, doing it
 * for extremely large result sets could potentially cause PHP to timeout or exceed available memory
 * (neither of which is a good thing). In most cases, the classic SQL design pattern of pulling data
 * and processing it one row at a time (using either mysql_fetch_assoc or cpdsql_result_row) is what
 * you want to do. However, there is an occasional need to get an entire table or query's result all
 * together in a single array, and this function will do that for you.

/** Get data from the first column next row of data in a MySQL result object
 *
 * Gets the next row from the given MySQL result object, checks for any errors, and gets the data in
 * the first column and that row and returns it.
 *
 * This is most useful when the result in question only contains one row with one column anyway. The
 * common use case for this is something like "SELECT `name` FROM `person` WHERE `id` = 345" where a
 * single person is going to match that query (and thus the result will only contain one row) and it
 * only has one piece of data in it (the name, which is all we need to get). This saves this step of
 * pulling off the row and grabbing the data every time something like this is done.
 * 
 * Don't forget to use a triple equals ("===") if you need to verify that there actually was another
 * row in the result that contained at least one column. If the column in question is set (in MySQL)
 * to NULL or the empty string, that will be returned. On the other hand, if the result set is empty
 * or all the rows have been already been gotten, then FALSE is returned. Thus, a double equals sign
 * ("==") is insufficient to distinguish between an empty value and no value.         
 *
 * @param {MySQL result} $result A MySQL result object from a successful MySQL query 
 * 
 * @return {string} Returns data (including null or "") for success, or FALSE on error

 * cpdsql will work with different database software, since the function names will be the same).

 * false both for an empty result set and for an invalid one (an error).
