 * ODBC driver for the CPDSQL function library. All of the functions in this file call into the ODBC
 * module in PHP (i.e., the odbc_* functions) to directly communicate with the SQL driver or server.
 * All of the main functions in the CPDSQL library eventually call one of these to do the final work
 * of running the SQL query, parsing the result object, and (when required) converting the data into
 * the requested format.
 * 
 * Since PHP's ODBC functions do not have a concept of a "default connection" (unlike some other SQL
 * engines, such as mysql), this driver requires that a connection be set with cpdsql_connection_set
 * before it can actually be used (the connection resource is returned by odbc_connect).  
 * 
 * To add a new SQL database engine to CPDSQL, just copy this file (changing the filename from -odbc
 * to whatever new engine is being supported) and reimplement each of these functions using PHP APIs
 * for that particular engine. In most cases the task should be as simple as changing a few function
 * names here any there, though thorough testing is encouraged. Contact the author of the module for
 * more information.

 *  
 * @return {ODBC result} The query result object; on error, FALSE (or exits, depending on config)

 * storing them all in memory like this is a very inefficient way of doing things. In fact, doing it
 * for extremely large result sets could potentially cause PHP to timeout or exceed available memory
 * (neither of which is a good thing). In most cases, the classic SQL design pattern of pulling data
 * and processing it one row at a time (using odbc_fetch_array or cpdsql_result_row) is the best way
 * to go about it. However, there is an occasional need to get an entire table or query's result all
 * together in a single array, and this function will do that for you.
 *

/** Get data from the first column next row of data in a ODBC result object
 *
 * Gets the next row from the given ODBC result object, checks for any errors, and finds the data in
 * the first column and that row and returns it.
 *
 * This is most useful when the result in question only contains one row with one column anyway. The
 * common use case for this is something like "SELECT `name` FROM `person` WHERE `id` = 345" where a
 * single person is going to match that query (and thus the result will only contain one row) and it
 * only has one piece of data in it (the name, which is all we need to get). This saves this step of
 * pulling off the row and grabbing the data every time something like this is done.
 * 
 * Don't forget to use a triple equals ("===") if you need to verify that there actually was another
 * row in the result that contained at least one column. If the column in question is set (with SQL)
 * to NULL or the empty string, that will be returned. On the other hand, if the result set is empty
 * or all the rows have been already been gotten, then FALSE is returned. Thus, a double equals sign
 * ("==") is insufficient to distinguish between an empty value and no value.         
 *

 *
